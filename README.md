# HHCBO
HHCBO is the surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm for the constrained bi-objective optimization problem with highly heterogeneous evaluations. Highly heterogeneous evaluations mean that the optimization problem has both the expensive objective and constraints that need the approximation by the surrogate model and the inexpensive objective and constraints that can be written as the explicit functions. 
There is an example of the constrained bi-objective optimization proble
